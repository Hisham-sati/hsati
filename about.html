        <h4>What I'm doing</h4>
        <p>
            I am currently writing my PhD thesis with Julien Grivaux and Damien Calaque, on the subject of twisting cochains in complex geometry and Chern classes in Deligne cohomology.

        <h4>What I've done</h4>
        <p>
            I graduated with an MMath (Mathematics) from the University of Oxford in 2016, after having finished my BA in Mathematics there. I wrote my main master's thesis (a translation and reader's guide to Toën and Vaquié's <i>Au-dessous de Spec Z</i>) under the supervision of Kobi Kremnitzer and Christopher Hollings, as well as an additional (unsupervised but examined) thesis on persistent homology.
