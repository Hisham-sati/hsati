            <h4>What I'm doing</h4>
            <p>
                I am currently writing my PhD thesis with Julien Grivaux and Damien Calaque, on the subject of twisting cochains in complex geometry and Chern classes in Deligne cohomology.

            <h4>What I've done</h4>
            <p>
                I graduated with an MMath (Mathematics) from the University of Oxford in 2016, after having finished my BA in Mathematics there. I wrote my main master's thesis (a translation and reader's guide to Toën and Vaquié's "Au-dessous de Spec Z") under the supervision of Kobi Kremnitzer and Christopher Hollings, as well as an unsupervised (examined) thesis on the subject of persistent homology.
