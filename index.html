            <h4>What I'm doing</h4>
            <p>
                I&apos;m currently writing my PhD thesis with Julien Grivaux and Damien Calaque, on the subject of <span class="emph">twisting cochains in complex geometry</span> and <span class="emph">Chern classes of coherent sheaves in Deligne cohomology</span>.
            </p>
            <h4>What I've done</h4>
            <p>
                I graduated with an MMath (Mathematics) from the University of Oxford in 2016, after having finished my BA in Mathematics there. I wrote my main master&apos;s thesis (a translation and reader&apos;s guide to Toën and Vaquié&apos;s <cite>Au-dessous de Spec Z</cite>) under the supervision of Kobi Kremnitzer and Christopher Hollings, as well as a thesis on the subject of persistent homology. Both can be found on the <a href="/papers">papers</a> page.
