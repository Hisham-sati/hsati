I am not at all a physicist, and my knowledge of quantum physics in particular comes solely from undergraduate courses that I followed years ago, and any reading I can get done when feeling mathematical but not inclined to work on my thesis.
However, after scanning through some papers by !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! [Bartlett](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0512103), [Baez, Lauda](https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2469), and [Lurie](https://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0465), my interest in quantum physics, and quantum computing especially, has come back with a vengeance.

Quantum computing has fascinated me ever since  I first studied it at university, despite being a self-proclaimed `non-physicist', swearing only to do `mathematical maths' and none of this applied stuff (a shameful phase that I am really glad I outgrew).
This is without a doubt almost entirely due to the incredible teaching of [Artur Ekert](http://www.arturekert.org), whose lectures were probably the best that I ever experienced as an undergrad/masters student.
Really, most of what I'm going to say comes from notes I took in these lectures, so hopefully I don't distort them too much.

One of the reasons that I'm posting this, apart from to help me to not forget it, is that quantum physics has such a strong link to $n$-category theory, but I don't know at all really how quantum computing fits into this [nPOV](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/nPOV) picture.
As a naive guess, I would think that there is some `string diagram' approach to all this, but I'd need to sit down and have a think about what exactly that would be...
So if anybody has any comments or references then I'd be more that interested to hear them!

# Foundational ideas #

Before diving in to the jacuzzi that is quantum circuitry, let's dip our toes in the vast ocean of quantum physics axiomatisation.
First of all though, a note on quantum computers in practice.
There are a bunch of companies that make `quantum computers', for example the [D-Wave](https://www.dwavesys.com), but these are of a completely different species to those that we're going to have a look at.
These computers work using [quantum annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_annealing) â€“ a sort of quantum version of [thermal annealing](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Simulated_annealing); what I'm going to talk about are [universal quantum computers](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Quantum_Turing_machine).
Quantum annealing lets you implement so-called hill-climbing algorithms, but many of the famous quantum algorithms, like Shor's, cannot be implemented in this way.Quantum annealing lets you implement so-called hill-climbing algorithms, but many of the famous quantum algorithms, like Shor's, cannot be implemented in this way.
I hate to be a cynic about something in which I am far from an expert, but it seems to me that calling systems like the D-Wave `quantum computers' is a way to boost sales by using not-entirely-false-but-definitely-misleading buzzwords.

Any way, capitalism aside, let's go get our feet wet.

## Quantum interference

- double slit (of course)
- why Kolmogorov additivity axiom fails
- relative phase
- decoherence

## Axiomatics

- probability amplitudes
- qubits

- state vectors
- unitary evolutions
- measurements
- composite systems

## Classical circuits

- reversibility
- no sqrt(NOT)
