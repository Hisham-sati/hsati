We could extend this definition slightly by defining them as mapping cones of identities: $\\mathrm{cone}(X^\\bullet\\xrightarrow{\\id}X^\\bullet)$ for complexes $X^\\bullet$; or we could generalise this even further and allow mapping cones of arbitrary automorphisms. The main point is that these things are all zero in $K(\\mathrm{Mod}_R)$, since the distinguished triangle $X^\\bullet\\to X^\\bullet\\to\\mathrm{cone}\\to X^\\bullet[1]$ ....... TODO"
