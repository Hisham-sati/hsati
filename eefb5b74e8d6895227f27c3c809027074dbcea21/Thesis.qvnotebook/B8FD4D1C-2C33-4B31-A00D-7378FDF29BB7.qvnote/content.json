      "data": "### Motivation for definitions of admissibility\n\nAs a first approximation to an explanation, we consider the category $\\mathcal{C}$ whose objects are pairs $(V,\\varphi)$ of finite-dimensional vector spaces along with an endomorphism, and the morphisms $f\\colon(V,\\varphi)\\to(W,\\psi)$ are the morphisms $f\\colon V\\to W$ of vector spaces such that the obvious square commutes (i.e. such that $f\\circ\\varphi=\\psi\\circ f$). We are constructing the toy example, where we replace vector bundles by vector spaces, and curvatures of connections by endomorphisms: we say that $(V,\\varphi)$ is **flat** if $\\varphi=0$.\n\n* Firstly, we consider the Grothendieck group $K(\\mathcal{C})$, whose objects are isomorphism classes of objects of $\\mathcal{C}$, and where, for each short exact sequence $0\\to A\\to B\\to C\\to 0$ in $\\mathcal{C}$ we introduce the relation $[A]-[B]+[C]=0$, whence $[(V,\\varphi)]+[(W,\\psi)]:=(V\\oplus W, \\varphi\\oplus\\psi)$.\nThen we introduce the relation $[(V,0)]\\sim[(0,0)]$ on $K(\\mathcal{C})$ to obtain $K(\\mathcal{C})/\\sim$.\n* Then, consider the endofunctor $E\\colon\\mathcal{C}\\to\\mathcal{C}$ that sends $(V,\\varphi)$ to $(V/\\Ker\\varphi,\\varphi)$. Write $L_E\\mathcal{C}$ to mean the localisation of $\\mathcal{C}$ at all morphisms that become isomorphisms after applying $E$, the set of which we call $\\mathcal{W}$.\n* **TODO:** is $\\mathcal{W}$ an Ore system or something nice like this?\n* **Lemma.** A morphism is in $\\mathcal{W}$ if and only if it is **admissible**, i.e. if and only if there exist decompositions $V\\cong V_1\\oplus V_2$ and $W\\cong W_1\\oplus W_2$ such that $\\varphi(V_1)=0$ and $\\psi(W_1)=0$, and $f\\colon V\\to W$ descends to an isomorphism $V/V_1\\xrightarrow{\\sim} W/W_1$.\n\n    **Proof.** Let $f\\colon(V,\\varphi)\\to(W,\\psi)$ be a morphism in $\\mathcal{W}$, i.e. such that $E(f)$ is an isomorphism. Then we take $V_1:=\\Ker\\varphi$ and $W_1:=\\Ker\\psi$.\n\n    Conversely, let $f\\colon(V,\\varphi)\\to(W,\\psi)$ be admissible. Then $V_1\\leqslant\\Ker\\varphi$, and so, by the third isomorphism theorem, $(V/V_1)/(\\Ker\\varphi/V_1)\\cong V/\\Ker\\varphi$. It remains then to show that $E(f)$ restricts to an isomorphism $\\Ker\\varphi/V_1\\xrightarrow{\\sim}\\Ker\\psi/W_1$. But $f\\circ\\varphi=\\psi\\circ f$, and so $E(f)\\circ E(\\varphi)\\circ E(f)^{-1}=E(\\psi)$, whence $E(f)\\colon\\Ker\\varphi/V_1=\\Ker E(\\varphi)\\xrightarrow{\\sim}\\Ker E(\\psi)=\\Ker\\psi/W_1$.\n\n* **Lemma.** There is a (canonical) isomorphism $K(L_E\\mathcal{C})\\to K(\\mathcal{C})/\\sim$.\n\n    **Proof.** It suffices to take the 'identity' map, as follows. Take two isomorphic objects $(V,\\varphi),(W,\\psi)\\in L_E\\mathcal{C}$. Then, either the isomorphism between them is given by an isomorphism in $\\mathcal{C}$, or by some morphism in $\\mathcal{W}$. In the former case, we are done; in the latter case, the above lemma tells us that there is an admissible decomposition $V\\cong V_1\\oplus V_2\\to W_1\\oplus W_2\\cong W$. But then both $(V_2,\\varphi)$ and $(W_2,\\psi)$ are equivalent to zero, whence $f\\colon(V_1,\\varphi)\\xrightarrow{\\sim}(W_1,\\psi)$ gives us an isomorphism in $K(\\mathcal{C})/\\sim$.\n    \n    Conversely, take two isomorphic objects $(V,\\varphi),(W,\\psi)\\in\\mathcal{C}$. Then they are also isomorphic in $L_E\\mathcal{C}$ (since all isomorphisms are in $\\mathcal{W}$). Further, if $[(V,\\varphi)]\\sim[(0,0)]$ in $K(\\mathcal{C})/\\sim$ then $\\varphi=0$, whence $V/\\Ker\\varphi=0$, and so $[(V,\\varphi)]=[(0,0)]\\in K(L_E\\mathcal{C})$.\n    \n* Now assume that we have some invariant (i.e. under base-change) polynomial $P$ from $\\mathcal{C}^{\\otimes n}$ to some (additive, say) abelian group $G$ (usually taken to be $\\mathbb{C}$). If $P$ is additive then it will descend to a well-defined polynomial on $K(\\mathcal{C})^{\\otimes n}$. If $P$ sends a tensor product of $n$ flat objects to zero then it also descends to a well-defined polynomial on $K(\\mathcal{C})/\\sim$. Thus, by the above lemma, we get $P$ defined on $K(L_E\\mathcal{C})$. This means, by the above-above lemma, that our characteristic classes are invariant under an admissible connection, and thus, in the admissible simplicial connection setting, the curvatures will glue.\n\n    There is some subtlety here though: the exponential Chern classes and the Chern character are both additive, but the usual Chern classes aren't. We can get around this, however, by not using the Grothendieck group $K(\\mathcal{C})$ in the above, but instead the 'smaller' version, where we say that $E+F=(E\\oplus F)$ only when at least one of $E$ and $F$ are flat."
