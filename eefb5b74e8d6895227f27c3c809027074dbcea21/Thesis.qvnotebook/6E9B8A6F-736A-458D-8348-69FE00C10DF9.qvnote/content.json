      "data": "### 28/05/2017\n\nOne question (though it’s really three or four questions in disguise…) about twisting/twisted objects/cochains/complexes (TCs, to make it easier). I currently have four definitions of a TC, and all of them should be equivalent, but I can’t quite figure out how some of them relate:\n\n1. Toledo, Tong 1976/78/81\n    * defined in a bicomplex; no real mention of categories\n    * used as a substitute for a global resolution of a sheaf by vector bundles\n2. Wei 2016\n    * dg-enchancement; very clearly a generalisation of TT76 etc.\n3. Keller 2001\n    * defined in an a-infinity category\n    * the Yoneda functor into the derived category factorises through the category of twisted objects; or considered as the closure under shifts and extensions\n    * equivalence between filtered modules and twisted objects\n4. Bondal, Kapranov 1981\n    * defined in a dg-category\n5. Faonte 2015\n    * defined in a dg-category\n    * generalisation of BK81\n    * the ’smallest’ way of being able to define a shift and functorial cone on a pre-triangulated dg-category\n(There is a fifth: Toledo, Tong 1986, where they work with ‘simplicial vector bundles’ – though these are not actually simplicial objects – but I’ve never heard of this approach used either before or after, so I don’t know if it’s too important).\n\nI can see how 2 generalises 1; how 5 generalises 4; but I have no idea how 3 fits in to the picture. Further, showing that 1/2 = 4/5 is not as easy as I thought. Bondal and Kapranov say that ‘it’s obvious’ but I can’t even seem to find the good category to work in.\n\nThis is just a lot of information in one email, so I don’t expect a full answer, but just thought I’d give you all the history behind what I’m trying to work out at the moment. Do you know of any references that link some of these ideas together, or is this an area you know and could explain some answers in? It seems to be something that people ‘just know’ but haven’t written down anywhere, as far as I can tell…\n\nMerci et cheers, Tim"

      "data": "### 28/05/2017\n\nHi Tim, \n\nfor a general picture about $A_\\infty$-categories, dg-categories and stable $\\infty$-categories, you can have a look at some lecture notes of a course I gave (this is pure self-promotion): http://school2016.imj-prg.fr/Notes/Calaque_by_Rivera.pdf (only the first lecture is concerned with dg- and $A_\\infty$-categories). by the way, Greg Ginot gave a great exercise session for this mini-course I gave. His notes shall be helpful... you should ask him ;-)\n\nAt the bottom of page 4 of these notes you'll find the definition of twisted objects in a dg-category. \nThis definition is exactly the same as the one of Bondal-Kapranov (I am referring to Definition 1 on page 95 of https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/bondalKaprEnhTRiangCat.pdf ). \nThis definition generalizes to $A_\\infty$-categories in an obvious way... the equation $d\\delta+\\delta^2=0$ becomes $\\sum_k m_k(\\delta,...,\\delta)=0$, where $m_1=d$, $m_2$ is the composition and higher $m_k$'s are higher homotopies for the associativity of composition (all $m_k$'s are the so-called $A_\\infty$-structure). Keller may has a more abstract characterization of tw($A$) but he also has an explicit description which is precisely what I said (up to sign issue that I like to ignore:-) ): see equation (7.1) on page 21 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/9910179.pdf\n\nI guess the relation between 1/2 and 4/5 is that one shall apply 3/4/5 to the category of modules over the Cech resolution $A=Cech(U,O_X)$ of $O_X$ with respect to a given acyclic open cover $U$ ($A$ is a dg-algebra). I would guess that twisted objects for $A$ in the sense of 3/4/5 are precisely the twisted guys of Toledo-Tong (which I'm not familiar with). Let me know if I'm wrong :)\n\n...\n\n> (There is a fifth: Toledo, Tong 1986, where they work with ‘simplicial vector bundles’ – though these are not actually simplicial objects – but I’ve never heard of this approach used either before or after, so I don’t know if it’s too important).\n\nThis one is probably again equivalent. \nNamely, the Cech resolution $A$ of $O_X$ is actually the normalization of a cosimplicial algebra obtained as follows: the nerve of the cover $U\\to X$ is a simplicial complex manifold, thus applying $O$ (a contravariant functor) we get a cosimplical algebra. taking the so-called reduced (a-k-a Moore) complex associated with this cosimplicial algebra you get $A$. \n\nNow a simplicial vector bundle is the data of a dg-vector bundle over each piece $U_i$ of the cover that satisfy a bunch of gluing conditions up to $d$. So, its a kind of twisting module for the cosimplicial algebra we got... \nApplying again a variant of Dold-Kan (the correspondence between (co)simplicial stuff and dg-stuff) one shall in the end get a twistingobject for $A$. \n\nSorry, these is not very precise, but I'm quite confident that this is the right thing. \n\nBest\n\nDamien\n"

      "data": "### 02/06/2017 \n\nDear Tim,\n\nlet's start with the data of a graded holomorphic vector bundle $\\mathcal E_\\alpha$ on every $U_\\alpha$. Let us write $U=(U_\\alpha)_\\alpha$ and $\\mathcal E=(\\mathcal E_\\alpha)_\\alpha$.\n\nI think we do agree that $E_0:=C(U,\\mathcal E)$ is a $B$-module, with $B=C(U,O_X)$ (just because on each $U_\\alpha$, $\\mathcal E_\\alpha$ is a complex of $\\mathcal O_{U_\\alpha}$-modules... well, it is a graded $\\mathcal O_{U_\\alpha}$-module, which I decide to see as a complex with trivial differential).\n\nLet me now put $E_i=0$ for every $i\\neq 0$.\n\nWhat does it mean then to say that $(E_i)_i$ has a twisted complex structure in the sense of [BK]?\n\nIt means that we have a degree 1 $B$-linear endomorphism $a:=q_{00}$ of $E_0$ such that $da+aa=0$.\n\nBut the dg-algebra of $B$-linear endomorphisms of $E_0$ is precisely $C(U,End(\\mathcal E))$ !!!!\nThus $a$ is a degree 1 element in $C(U,End(\\mathcal E))$ satisfying $da+aa=0$.\nThen we decompose $a$ as a sum (over $k$) of $a^{k,1-k}\\in C^k(U,End^{1-k}(\\mathcal E))$.\n\nSo any [TT] holomorphic twisting cochain gives an example of a [BK] twisted complex in the dg-category $B$-mod (of dg-$B$-modules)\n\nSo, the main mistake not to do is to believe that there is a relation between the $i$'s from [BK] and the $k$'s from [TT] ;-)\n\nIn the end, holomorphic twisting cochains in the sense of [TT] are particular examples of twisted complexes in $B$-mod in the sense of [BK].\nThey are actually very special examples. For instance:\n- they are such that only one $E_i$ is non-zero (while in [BK] finitely many may be non-zero).\n- they arrize as $C(U,E)$, where $U$ is graded. In Keller's context this may be similar to restricting oneself to those $B$-modules obtained as sums of shifts of free/projective $B$-modules.\n- there is no analog of the \"normalization\" condition 2 from [TT] in [BK].\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nBest\n\nDamien"
