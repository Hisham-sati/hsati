      "data": "## Day 2\n\n### OK, forget about Steifel manifolds...\n\n* $\\GL_r/\\GL_{r-s}$ does **not** give us $s$-frames. Woops. The point is that $U(n)/U(r-s)$ gives us partial **orthonormal** frames, but this is because there is sort of a lemma that a partial orthonormal frame 'already contains the information of a complement'. Also note that the dimensions aren't equal, e.g. $\\dim(\\GL_r/\\GL_1)=r^2-1$, but the space of $(r-1)$-frames (_without a choice of complement_) has dimension $r(r-1)=r^2-r$\n* Using Gram-Schmidt (with a global parameter) we can obtain a (strong) deformation retract from partial frames to orthonormal such ones, and so the homology of these two spaces is the same (thank goodness), i.e. we can still use the argument from [BM96] to construct these 'sections up to homotopy'\n* **The 'good' space to use is built as follows**.\n    - $(r-1)$-frames: we let $\\mathbb{C}^{r-1}$ act on $\\GL_r$ by considering matrices of the form $$\\begin{pmatrix}1&*&*&\\cdots&*\\\\0&1&0&\\cdots&0\\\\0&0&1&&0\\\\\\vdots&&&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\0&0&0&\\cdots&1\\end{pmatrix}$$\n    - $(r-2)$-frames: we let $\\mathbb{C}^{(r-1)(r-2)}$ act on $\\GL_r$ by considering matrices of the form $$\\begin{pmatrix}1&*&*&\\cdots&*\\\\0&1&*&\\cdots&*\\\\0&0&1&&0\\\\\\vdots&&&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\0&0&0&\\cdots&1\\end{pmatrix}$$\n    - ...\n    - $(r-s)$-frames: we let $\\mathbb{C}^{(r-1)\\ldots(r-s)}$ act on $\\GL_r$ by considering matrices of the form $I+T$, where $T$ is **strictly** upper triangular **and** is zero in the last $(r-s)$ rows (although, of course, it **is** allowed to be zero elsewhere).\n\n### Lie algebras and endomorphisms\n\n* $\\End(V)\\cong\\operatorname{Lie}(\\GL(V))=:\\mathfrak{gl}(V)$ since (after picking a basis to make the argument easier) any matrix $M$ (i.e. an element of $\\End(\\mathbb{C}^r)$) gives a path through the identity by $I+tM$ whose derivative is exactly $M$, and thus is a tangent to the identity of $\\GL_r$ (i.e. an element of the Lie algebra of $\\GL_r$), and conversely any tangent to the identity of $GL_r$ is a matrix.\n\n### The first Chern class\n\n* Let $E\\xrightarrow{\\pi}X$ be a rank-$r$ **trivial** bundle with sections $e^i$; let $\\nabla_E=\\d+A$ (where $\\d=\\d_e$ is the trivial connection for the $e^i$); let $P=X\\times\\GL_r\\xrightarrow{\\rho}X$ be the fibre bundle of frames in $E$ (i.e. _the frame bundle_); let $s^i$ be the sections of $\\rho^*E$ given by $s^i\\colon(x,M)\\mapsto ((x,M),Me^i)$ (because we know that $\\rho^*E$ is trivial **even if $E$ is not**, i.e. $\\rho^*E\\cong (X\\times\\GL_r)\\times\\mathbb{C}^r$).\n* We want to compute the $1$-form on $P$ given by $\\tr(\\nabla_{\\rho^*E}-\\d_s)$ (where $\\nabla_{\\rho^*E}=\\rho^*\\nabla_E$), so we use the basis $s^i$.\n* The computation is almost identical to those which we have done many times now:\n    - $\\mathrm{d}_s s^i = 0$ by definition of $\\mathrm{d}_{s^i}$\n    - $\\nabla_{\\rho^*E}(s^i) = \\nabla_{\\rho^*E}\\left(\\sum_j M^i_je^j\\right) \\overset{\\text{Leib.}}{=} \\sum_jM^i_j\\nabla_{\\rho^*E}(e^j) + \\sum_j\\d M^i_j\\otimes e^j$\n    - but $\\nabla_{\\rho^*E}(e^j)= \\sum_k A^j_k e^k$ since the $e^i$ are flat for $\\d_e$\n    - whence we get $\\sum_{j,k}\\d M^i_j(M^{-1})^j_k\\otimes s^k + \\sum_{j,k,l}M^i_jA^j_k(M^{-1})^k_l$, i.e. $$\\tr\\left(\\d M(M^{-1})+MAM^{-1}\\right)$$\n\n### Back to principal bundles\n\n* Linear connections (also called _Koszul connections_) on a vector bundle $E$ are equivalent to **principal $\\GL_r$-connections** on the corresponding principal $\\GL_r$-bundle $P$ of frames, which are defined to be (for a principal $\\GL_r$-bundle $P$) $\\mathfrak{gl}_r$-valued $1$-forms on $P$ that are **$\\GL_r$-equivariant** and **reproduce** the $\\mathfrak{gl}_r$-generators of the fundamental vector fields on $P$, i.e. a connection is given by some **connection form** $$\\omega\\in\\Omega_P^1\\otimes\\mathfrak{gl}_r$$ such that\n    - $\\mathrm{Ad}_g(R_g^*\\omega)=\\omega$ for all $g\\in\\GL_r$\n    - $\\omega(\\xi^\\#)=\\xi$ for all $\\xi\\in\\mathfrak{gl}_r$.\n* The first condition above is the commutativity of the diagram $$\\begin{array}{rcl}T_pP&\\xrightarrow{\\omega}&\\mathfrak{gl}_r\\\\{\\scriptsize R_g}\\downarrow&&\\downarrow {\\scriptsize\\mathrm{Ad}_{g^{-1}}}\\\\T_{p\\cdot g}P&\\xrightarrow{\\omega}&\\mathfrak{gl}_r\\end{array}$$\n* (There is a more general equivalence between principal $G$-connections and $G$-equivariant Ehresmann connections.)\n* The **curvature form** is given by $$\\Omega=\\d\\omega+\\frac12[\\omega,\\omega]\\in\\Omega_P^2\\otimes\\mathfrak{gl}_r$$ where the Lie bracket is that of $\\mathfrak{gl}_r$ (recall that we always take the wedge product on the form part) (N.B. since we have a matrix Lie group, we can really think of $[-,-]$ as the Lie bracket, and we have, for forms $\\alpha,\\beta$ of degree $p,q$ resp., $[\\alpha,\\beta]=\\alpha\\beta-(-1)^{pq}\\beta\\alpha$).\n* **Lemma.** Both $\\omega$ and $\\Omega$ are $\\mathfrak{gl}_r$-equivariant; $\\omega$ is vertical and $\\Omega$ is horizontal.\n* **(Second) structure equation.** $\\operatorname{D}\\omega=\\Omega$.\n* **(Second) Bianchi identity.** $\\operatorname{D}\\Omega=0$.\n* TODO: interpretation (and definition!) of $\\operatorname{D}$ in terms of $\\d$\n\n### Invariant polynomials\n\n* $P_2(M,N)=\\text{some alternating sum of }\\frac12\\left[\\tr\\left(\\bigwedge^2(M+N)\\right)-\\tr\\left(\\bigwedge^2 M\\right) -\\tr\\left(\\bigwedge^2 N\\right)\\right]$\n* Comes from the calculation of $x*y$ in terms of the degree 1 generators in the symmetric algebra: $$(x+y)*(x+y)=x*x+2x*y+y*y$$ whence $$2x*y=(x+y)^2-x^2-y^2$$ where $x*y:=\\frac12(x\\otimes y+y\\otimes x)$.\n* We are interested in $P_2(\\Omega,\\omega)$.\n* TODO: why are we interested in this? (answer: 'take $\\mathrm{D}$')\n* TODO: write out the full thing (i.e. get rid of the 'some alternating sum of' above)\n\n### Descending to the quotient\n\n* We want to define some form on $P$ that descends to a quotient, instead of pulling back over the space of partial frames (like before when we looked at $P/\\GL_s$ instead of $P\\times_{\\GL_r}\\GL_r/\\GL_s$).\n* TODO: lemma. need things to be horizontal and equivariant (?)\n* TODO: proposition. what we have satisfies this"

      "data": "## Day 1\n\n### Leibnitz rule\n\n* Justifying the Leibnitz rule on $s^i=M\\cdot\\begin{pmatrix}\\delta_{0i}\\\\\\delta_{1i}\\end{pmatrix}$ is done element-wise: note two important things:\n    - the **order** is $\\nabla(fs)=f\\nabla(s)+\\mathrm{d}f\\otimes s$, i.e. $f$ is always on the _left_;\n    - we shouldn't really write $\\mathrm{d}M\\otimes\\begin{pmatrix}\\delta_{0i}\\\\\\delta_{1i}\\end{pmatrix}$ because the tensor product should be between _forms_ and _endomorphisms_, but $\\mathrm{d}M$ is both... so for the moment I'll write $\\widetilde{\\otimes}$ to mean '_it's the tensor product but the terms are kind of mixed up_'\n* When we do Leibnitz properly, we get $\\mathrm{d}M\\widetilde{\\otimes}M^{-1}s^i$, which gives us $(\\mathrm{d}M)M^{-1}$, which, **since we take the trace** (and so have cyclic commutativity), gives us the $M^{-1}\\mathrm{d}M$ that we know and love\n\n### Local sections and intrinsic-ness\n\n* For the moment, we **do** take local sections of our vector bundle, because otherwise we can't really do any calculations! Even when you just write that the intrinsic sections are given by 'the $i$-th column of the representative matrix' **you are implicitly (and sneakily) using local sections**.\n* Eventually we hope to find something that _doesn't_ need local sections, but let's take this one step at a time...\n* We should formalise this as follows: the local sections $s_\\alpha^i$ for $E\\to X$ give us local sections of $\\rho^*E\\to A_k^E$, and then the canonical ones are defined as, over a point $(x,[M])$ (**writing a point like this means that we have trivialised $E$ — this is the sneaky use of local sections**) as the image of the $s_\\alpha^i$ under $M$, i.e. the $i$-th column of $M$, since, again, just to be clear, _we are using the $s_\\alpha^i$ to trivialise our bundle_.\n* Remember that, when we say a $G$-torsor is isomorphic to $G$, we are _picking a trivialisation_.\n\n### What $A_k^E$ really is\n\n* ~~$A_k^E:=P\\times_{\\GL_r}W_{n-k+1}^r$, i.e. the equivalence classes are given by the action of $\\GL_r$, **not** $\\mathrm{SL}_n$; we are using $\\GL_r$ instead of $U(r)$ (i.e. 'not normalised') and so it sort of seems natural.~~\n* ~~Much 'better' to think of $A_k^E$ as $P/\\GL_{k-1}$ (so, for example, points in $A$ are **not** given by pairs $(x,[M])$ **unless we choose a local trivialisation**).~~\n* ~~$A_k^E$ is **not** a _principal_ bundle over $X$, but just a _fibre_ bundle; it **is**, however, a $GL_{(k-1)?}$-principal bundle over the space of rank-$(k-1)?$ quotients of $E$ (or, at least, some statement like this is true, but we don't really care so much).~~\n* ~~$A_k^E$ is more than just the space of $(r-k+1)$-frames: it is the choice of such frames **plus** a _complement_. This means, in particular, that the bit where we say 'assume that there are some never-colinear sections of $\\rho^*E$ ' is unnecessary, and also that extending the trivial connection on the trivial sub-bundle to one on the whole of $\\rho^*E$ is conceptually much clearer: it is equivalent to picking a connection on the complement. Primarily, pulling back $E$ over $A_k^E$ is exactly the same as obtaining a (canonical) direct-sum decomposition $\\rho^*E\\cong T^{r-k+1}_{A_k^E}\\oplus V$ — the trivial sub-bundle is exactly the span of the intrinsic $s^i$.~~"
