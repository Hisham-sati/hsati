Green's construction (plus Dupont's fibre integration) gives us classes in Hodge cohomology for simplicial vector bundles\n3. Julien's thesis/paper tells us what we need to show these classes satisfy to know that they are Chern classes (since he's already proved that Hodge cohomology satisfies nice enough properties)\n    1. _agrees on line bundles_: this is a straightforward calculation\n    2. _functorial under pullbacks_: N.B. for coherent sheaves, we get that the Chern class of the derived pullback is the pullback of the Chern class, but using Green's resolution we can work with the usual pullback to calculate the derived one, i.e. we just need to show that the Chern class of simplicial vector bundles is functorial under the true pullback\n    3. _Whitney sum for short exact sequences_: using the below lemma, it suffices to show this for split exact sequences of coherent sheaves, but this is in Green\n    4. _Riemann-Roch for closed immersions_: apparently this follows from the other three properties by ``deformations to the normal cone'' or some such algebraic geometry magic\n\n**Lemma.** If Chern classes are additive on every split exact sequence of coherent sheaves then they are additive on every short exact sequence of coherent sheaves.\n\n**Proof.** Let $0\\to\\mathscr{F}\\xrightarrow{\\iota}\\mathscr{G}\\xrightarrow{\\pi}\\mathscr{H}\\to0$ be a short exact sequence of coherent sheaves on $X$, and $t\\in\\mathbb{C}$ (which can be thought of as $t\\in\\Gamma(\\mathbb{C},\\mathbb{P}^1)$). Write $p\\colon X\\times\\mathbb{P}^1\\to X$ to mean the projection map. Define\n\\begin{equation*}\n    \\mathscr{N} = \\Ker\\big(p^*\\mathscr{G}(1)\\oplus p^*\\mathscr{H}\\xrightarrow{\\pi(1)-t\\cdot\\id}p^*\\mathscr{H}(1)\\big)\n\\end{equation*}\nwhere $(\\pi(1)-t\\cdot\\id)\\colon (g\\otimes y, h)\\mapsto \\pi(g)\\otimes y - h\\otimes t$. We claim that this gives a short exact sequence\n\\begin{equation}\n    0\\to p^*\\mathscr{F}(1)\\to\\mathscr{N}\\to p^*\\mathscr{H}\\to0\n\\end{equation}\nof sheaves over $X\\times\\mathbb{P}^1$ where the maps are the 'obvious' ones: $p^*\\mathscr{F}(1)\\to\\mathscr{N}$ is the map $\\iota(1)\\colon p^*\\mathscr{F}(1)\\to p^*\\mathscr{G}(1)$ included into $p^*\\mathscr{G}(1)\\oplus p^*\\mathscr{H}$ (which we prove lands in $\\mathscr{N}$ below); and $\\mathscr{N}\\to p^*\\mathscr{H}$ is the projection $p^*\\mathscr{G}(1)\\oplus p^*\\mathscr{H}\\to p^*\\mathscr{H}$ restricted to $\\mathscr{N}$.\n\nTo prove surjectivity, let $h\\in\\Gamma(U,p^*\\mathscr{H})$. Then $h\\otimes t\\in\\Gamma(U,p^*\\mathscr{H}(1))$. But $\\pi\\colon\\mathscr{G}\\to\\mathscr{H}$ is surjective, and thus so too is the induced map $\\pi(1)\\colon p^*\\mathscr{G}(1)\\to p^*\\mathscr{H}(1)$, hence there exists $g\\otimes y\\in\\Gamma(U,p^*\\mathscr{G}(1))$ such that $\\pi(g\\otimes y)=h\\otimes t$. Thus $(g\\otimes y, h)\\in\\mathscr{N}$ maps to $h$.\n\nTo prove injectivity (and that this map is indeed well defined), we use the fact that tensoring with $\\mathscr{O}(1)$ is exact, and so, in particular, $\\iota(1)\\colon p^*\\mathscr{F}(1)\\to p^*\\mathscr{G}(1)$ is injective. The inclusion into the direct sum $p^*\\mathscr{G}(1)\\oplus p^*\\mathscr{H}$ is injective by the definition of a direct sum, so all that remains to show is that the image of this composite map is contained inside $\\mathscr{N}$. Let $f\\otimes x\\in\\Gamma(U,p^*\\mathscr{F}(1))$. Then this maps to $(\\iota(f)\\otimes x,0)\\in p^*\\mathscr{G}(1)\\oplus p^*\\mathscr{H}$, but this is clearly in the kernel of $\\pi(1)-t\\cdot\\id$ since $\\pi\\iota(f)=0$.\n\nTo prove exactness, it suffices to show that $\\Ker(\\mathscr{N}\\to p^*\\mathscr{F})\\cong p^*\\mathscr{F}(1)$. But\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\Ker(\\mathscr{N}\\to p^*\\mathscr{F}) &= \\{(g\\otimes y, h)\\in\\mathscr{N} \\mid h=0\\}\\\\\n    &= \\{(g\\otimes y, h)\\in p^*\\mathscr{G}(1)\\oplus p^*\\mathscr{H} \\mid h=0\\text{ and }\\pi(g)\\otimes y-h\\otimes t=0\\}\\\\\n    &= \\{(g\\otimes y, h)\\in p^*\\mathscr{G}(1)\\oplus p^*\\mathscr{H} \\mid \\pi(g)\\otimes y=0\\}\\\\\n    &= \\{(g\\otimes y, h)\\in p^*\\mathscr{G}(1)\\oplus p^*\\mathscr{H} \\mid (g\\otimes y)\\in\\Im\\iota(1)\\}\\\\\n    &\\cong p^*\\mathscr{F}(1).\n\\end{align*}\n\nNow we claim that the short exact sequence is split for $t=0$, and has $\\mathscr{N}\\cong p^*\\mathscr{G}$ for $t\\neq0$. Formally, we do this by looking at the pullback of the map $X\\times\\{t\\}\\to X\\times\\mathbb{P}^1$, but for the moment we just `pick a value for $t$'.\n\nFor $t=0$: by definition,\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\mathscr{N} &= \\Ker\\big(p^*\\mathscr{G}(1)\\oplus p^*\\mathscr{H}\\xrightarrow{\\pi(1)-t\\cdot\\id}p^*\\mathscr{H}(1)\\big)\\\\\n    &= \\Ker\\big(p^*\\mathscr{G}(1)\\oplus p^*\\mathscr{H}\\xrightarrow{\\pi(1)}p^*\\mathscr{H}(1)\\big)\\\\\n    &\\cong \\Ker\\big(p^*\\mathscr{G}(1)\\xrightarrow{\\pi(1)}p^*\\mathscr{H}(1)\\big) \\oplus p^*\\mathscr{H}\\\\\n    &\\cong p^*\\mathscr{F}(1)\\oplus p^*\\mathscr{H}.\n\\end{align*}\nFor $t\\neq0$: define the injective morphism $\\varphi\\colon p^*\\mathscr{G}\\to\\mathscr{N}$ of coherent sheaves by $\\varphi(g)=(g\\otimes t,\\pi(g))$. To see that this is also surjective, let $(g\\otimes y, h)\\in\\mathscr{N}$. If $y=0$ then we must have $h=0$, and so $(g\\otimes y, h) = (0,0) = \\varphi(0\\otimes0)$. If $y\\neq0$ then $\\pi(g)\\otimes y-h\\otimes t=0$, with $y,t\\neq0$, whence $\\pi(g)=\\frac{y}{t}h$. Then $(g\\otimes y, h) = (\\frac{t}{y}g\\otimes t, \\pi(\\frac{t}{y}g)) = \\varphi(\\frac{t}{y}g).$\n\nAs one final ingredient, note that any coherent sheaf on $X$ pulled back to a sheaf on $X\\times\\mathbb{P}^1$ is flat over $\\mathbb{P}^1$, and so $\\mathscr{N}$ is flat over $\\mathbb{P}^1$, since both $\\mathscr{F}(1)$ and $\\mathscr{H}$ are. Thus, for $\\tau_t\\colon X\\times\\{t\\}\\to X\\times\\mathbb{P}^1$ given by a choice of $t\\in\\mathbb{C}$, the derived pullback $\\mathbb{L}\\tau_t^*\\mathscr{N}$ agrees with the usual pullback $\\tau_t^*\\mathscr{N}$.\n\nNow we use the $\\mathbb{P}^1$-homotopy invariance of de Rham cohomology: the induced map\n\\begin{equation*}\n    \\tau_t^*\\colon\\H^\\bullet\\big(X\\times\\mathbb{P}^1,\\Omega_{X\\times\\mathbb{P}^1}^\\bullet\\big) \\to \\H^\\bullet\\big(X\\times\\{t\\},\\Omega_{X\\times\\{t\\}}^\\bullet\\big)\n\\end{equation*}\ndoesn't depend on the choice of $t$. Since $X\\times\\{t\\}$ is (canonically) homotopic to $X$, we can identify $(p\\tau_t)^*$ with the identity on $\\H^\\bullet(X,\\Omega_X^\\bullet)$. Since the SES splits for $t=0$, by our hypothesis, flatness, and the fact that Green's construction is functorial under derived pullback, we know that\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\tau_0^*c(\\mathscr{N}) = c(\\mathbb{L}\\tau_0^*\\mathscr{N}) = c(\\tau_0^*\\mathscr{N}) &= c(\\tau_0^*p^*\\mathscr{F}(1)\\oplus\\tau_0^*p^*\\mathscr{H})\\\\\n    &= c(\\mathscr{F})\\wedge c(\\mathscr{H}).\n\\end{align*}\nBut we also know that $\\mathscr{N}\\cong p^*\\mathscr{G}$ for $t\\neq0$, and so\n\\begin{equation*}\n    c(\\mathscr{G}) = (p\\tau_t)^*c(\\mathscr{G}) = \\tau_t^*c(\\mathscr{N}).\n\\end{equation*}\nSo, finally, the $t$-invariance of $\\tau^*$ tells us that\n\\begin{equation*}\n    c(\\mathscr{G}) = c(\\mathscr{F})\\wedge c(\\mathscr{H}).\n\\end{equation*}"
